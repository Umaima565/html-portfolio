<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hello! I’m Umaima Zubair, a 20-year-old student from Karachi, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Karachi University. My passion for technology and problem-solving has led me to explore the exciting world of web development, where I enjoy creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites.</p>

<p>Throughout my studies, I’ve worked on several projects that showcase my skills and creativity.
